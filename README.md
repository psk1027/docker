what is container ?
=>
A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

Containers are similar to virtual machines (VMs) in that they both provide a way to run software in an isolated environment. However, containers are much more lightweight than VMs, which makes them faster and more efficient.

Here is an analogy that might help you understand containers better. Imagine a shipping container. A shipping container is a large, metal box that is used to transport goods. It has everything that is needed to keep the goods safe and secure during transportation: a sturdy exterior, a lockable door, and a ventilation system.

Containers are like shipping containers for software. They provide a safe and secure environment for applications to run, and they make it easy to transport applications from one environment to another.
